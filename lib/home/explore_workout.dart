Pay attention to your breathing, running form, and overall comfort. You should be able to hold a conversation without much effort.\n\nRemember, the purpose of an easy run is to promote active recovery and provide a break from higher-intensity workouts. It helps to maintain consistency in your training and aids in building endurance over time. '

Instead of a light jog at an easy pace, you'll be pushing your body, getting your heart rate up and testing your stamina. You'll be running faster than your regular pace but for a shorter duration. \n A threshold pace, on the other hand, can be held steadily (albeit not too comfortably) for at least 20 minutes or up to one hour, in a race lasting that long. \n How to get your Tempo Pace? \n Measure the pace at which you can run an hour-long race. This might be your 10K race pace, or the fastest pace you can maintain for an hour. Divide the distance with your running time to get your pace. \n Credits: Nike, Runner'sWorld",
