**Proposed Level of Achievement:**

Project Gemini

**Motivation:**

One problem that people face when they want to start working out is that they do not know where to start, be it IPPT, Half Marathon Training or Weight Training. Some people would even like to train in a hyrbid style of both running and strength training, which not many applications have incorporated that. 

Thus, we strive to provide you with training plans that will cater to your fitness goals and to be in the best physical shape of your life. We provide training guides, a structured plan, and a workout log for you to keep track of your goals. 

**Aim:**

To provide user with training plans to reach their fitness goals. 

**User Stories:**

1\. As a user who does not know what training plan to select, I want to have a suitable

training plan to reach my fitness goals. 

2\. As a user who wants to train both running and strength, I want to be able to have a training

regime that incorporates both.

3\. As a user, I want to be able to track my workout progress over time and be able to see the 

improvement that I have made over a period of time. 

4\. As a user, I want to have guides to teach me how to perform a certain exercise if I am not 

sure of the proper technique.
